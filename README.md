# Ninety-Nine Problems in Scala 
### These are an adaptation of [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) written by Werner Hett.
* The majority of solution contains a recursive/built-in version of solution, but some contains one of the two only.
* Each solution contains a few test cases.
* I'm beginner at scala, so my solutions may not the best even though I always did my best.
* I sincerely welcome any kind of feedback or improvement!
